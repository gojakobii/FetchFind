# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

1. Clone down the FetchFind frontend repository and change directories

```console
git clone https://github.com/gojakobii/FetchFind.git
cd FetchFind
```

2. Install dependencies

```console
npm install
```

3. Run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

```console
npm start
```

Here at Fetch, we love dogs, and hope you do too! Your task is to build a website to help a dog-lover like yourself search through a database of shelter dogs, with the hope of finding a lucky dog a new home!
